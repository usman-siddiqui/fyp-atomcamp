Objective of the Project:
   	The goal of this project is to create a chatbot using OpenAI's language model. This chatbot is designed to answer questions about a restaurant's menu. It uses Pinecone, a vector database, to retrieve relevant information and maintains a history of conversations to handle follow-up questions effectively.

Components of the Project:

   Pinecone Index: 
The Pinecone index is used to store and search vector embeddings of restaurant menu data.
When a user asks a question, the project retrieves the most relevant information from the Pinecone index by comparing the vector embedding of the question with stored embeddings.

   OpenAI GPT Model:
The GPT model is responsible for generating responses to user questions.
It is guided by a system prompt to ensure that answers are concise and accurate.
The model also uses conversation history to keep track of context across multiple interactions.

   Gradio Interface:
The Gradio interface allows users to interact with the chatbot.
Users type their questions into the interface, and the chatbotâ€™s responses are displayed in a text field.
   Database for conversation History:
A MySQL database, hosted on freesqldatabase.com, is connected to the project to store conversation history.
This history helps the chatbot remember previous interactions and handle follow-up questions more intelligently.

Workflow:
   User Query:
The user inputs a question into the Gradio interface.
   Embedding and Retrieval:
The question is transformed into an embedding using a model like Sentence-Transformer.
This embedding is then used to search the Pinecone index for relevant menu items or restaurant details.

   Response Generation:
The information retrieved from the Pinecone index, along with conversation history, is sent to the GPT model.
The model generates a response, which is then displayed to the user via the Gradio interface.

   Maintaining Conversation History:
The conversation history is updated with each new interaction and stored in the database.
This history is used to keep context in future questions, allowing the chatbot to handle follow-up queries effectively.

Error Handling:
 	IndexError Handling
The project includes methods to handle potential errors, such as an IndexError that might occur when retrieving documents from Pinecone. This ensures that the chatbot remains reliable even if something unexpected happens. 
This project demonstrates how advanced NLP models, combined with a user-friendly interface and efficient data retrieval systems, can create a chatbot that is both responsive and aware of the context of previous interactions.
